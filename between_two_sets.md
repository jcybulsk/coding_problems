# Between Two Sets

Consider two sets of positive integers, A={a0, a1, ... , a(n-1)} and B={b0, b1, ... , b(n-1)} we say 
that a positive integer, x, is between sets A and B if the following conditions are satisfied:

 - All elements in A are factors of x.
 - x is a factor of all elements in B.
 
Given A and B, find and print the number of integers (i.e., all possible x's) between the two sets.
