# Caesar Cipher

Julius Caesar protected his confidential information by encrypting it in a cipher. Caesar's cipher 
rotated every letter in a string by a fixed number, K, making it unreadable by his enemies. Given 
a string, S, and a number, K, encrypt S and print the resulting string.

**Note**: The cipher only encrypts letters; symbols, such as '-', remain unencrypted.
