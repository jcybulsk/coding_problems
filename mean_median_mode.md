# Calculating Mean, Median, and Mode

Given an array, X, of N integers, calculate and print the respective mean, median, and mode 
on separate lines. If your array contains more than one modal value, choose the numerically 
smallest one.

Note: Other than the modal value (which will always be an integer), your answers should be 
in decimal form, rounded to a scale of 1 decimal place.
